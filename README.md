# fetchRewardsWebApp

Create an item class in Model consisting of id, list id, name and name id. In Controller, pass the url and read the json file. Deserialize json to convert it into object. Create a list to store these item fields and ultimately pass this list to View.  Use condition to consider only those items whose name is not empty or null and then add each field to list. Sort the list according to list IDs first and then sort by names using name ID which is present in column - Name in which name id is value of the particular item(for eg in item 970, 970 is name ID). After sorting, pass the list to view. And ultimately run the web application.
